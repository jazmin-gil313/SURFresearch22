Diameter Measurements based on GeoDict Data
Number of lines: 962
Unit: meters

Extra Notes:
Diameter measurements were taken from GeoDict instead of from the scans since I couldn’t figure out an easy way to separate hair strands when they collided in the scans. Since GeoDict has published research on separating multiple objects that collided, I concluded that their measurements would be more accurate than my own.
